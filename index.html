          Today we had our second fun meeting, where had a lot of fun everyone
          prepared an activity
          <span class="font-medium">Rohith Krishna</span> Started with his
          amazing magic tricks then
          <span class="font-medium">Tanmay</span> prepared a guessing game for
          us where we had to guess the name of a song with certain emojis (
          <span class="font-medium">Vidhi</span>
          guessed most of it as they were Hindi songs &#128539; ).
        </p>
        <p>
          Later on, <span class="font-medium">Bhavana</span> introduce a game
          where one member will draw and others had to guess the object name and
          gain the point. And then we had a musical performance from
          <span class="font-medium">Kranthi</span> which is really melodious.
          Thank you for all your efforts
        </p>
        <p>
          We missed most of our members today &#128532; I hope everyone will be
          able to join the next Friday's session with more exciting and joyful
          activities.

        <p class="font-semibold">Happy weekend!!</p>
